# SCI-Tools

This project is filled with 3 different tools for data analysis. Each one has a dedicated matlab GUI (.fig) with its corresponding function file (.m)

## Gait Tool

This file analyzes data for the Gait of rats with spinal cord injuries. It plots the raw data and the user can use the GUI to filter the data and pull the intended data from the raw files.

## Intensity Tool

This tool allows a user to analyze images based on the intensity of the pixels. This is useful for micropsopy data. The functions take the colored image and normalize them in black and white to measure the intensity on an equal scale.

## Urodynamics Tool

This tool allows a user to analyze EMG data from experiments. The user can review and capture muscle spikes from a large dataset.
